Submitted by: **Zorah Neal**

**Project 3** is a movie browsing app that allows users to browse movies currently playing in theaters.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ x] **Make a request to [The Movie Database API's `now_playing`](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-now-playing) endpoint to get a list of current movies**
- [ x] **Parse through JSON data and implement a RecyclerView to display all movies**
- [ x] **Use Glide to load and display movie poster images**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [ ] Implement orientation responsivity
  - App should neatly arrange data in both landscape and portrait mode
- [ ] Implement Glide to display placeholder graphics during loading

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
